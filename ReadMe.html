<h3>20130329: Note from the ModelDB administrator: </h3>

This model used to be supplied by the far below link to the ybanitt
web site which is broken.  The model is now made available in this
archive which is a copy of the original model with some modifications
including this ReadMe.  The ReadMe file in the original code
identifies ssc.hoc as the main file.

<p/>

Michael Hines suggested an edit which has been incorporated here that
makes the old code compatible with the most recent version of neuron:
in iA.mod a tadj calculation was moved out of the INITIAL block to
below the TABLE statement in PROCEDURE mhn(v). Michael explains the
reasoning:

<p/>

"The underlying behavior change is that threads demand that tables be
computed before the call to INITIAL. At that time, of course, tadj=0
hence a divide by 0 and a cascade of other things.  I regret that
change from old implementation dependent behavior ... The underlying
issue is that multiple threads are calling INITIAL and it is generally
a bad idea in that situation to assign a value to a global variable.
<p/> The catch 22 is that if you turn off the table( usetable_iA = 0)
then the calculation of tadj is fairly expensive."
